# üò∑ Face Mask Detection using MobileNetV2  

This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask in images or webcam feed using a **MobileNetV2** model.  
The final app is deployed with a **Gradio** interface, featuring real-time predictions, interactive output, and a custom CSS design.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is a **Face Mask Detection Dataset** (public datasets from Kaggle or collected manually).  

- Contains **X images** of faces with and without masks.  
- Each image is labeled as:  
  - **With Mask** ‚Üí Person is wearing a mask  
  - **Without Mask** ‚Üí Person is not wearing a mask

## ü§ñ Model Comparison  

Several models were trained and compared for accuracy and generalization:

| Model                  | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Notes |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| CNN from scratch        | 0.90            | 0.88             | Fast but less robust on new images |
| MobileNetV2             | 0.95            | 0.93             | Lightweight, better performance on external images |
| (Future: EfficientNet)  | TBD             | TBD              | Could improve generalization |

‚úÖ MobileNetV2 was selected as the final model for its balance between performance and size.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **External images not recognized** | Applied data augmentation + face detection preprocessing |
| **Multiple faces in one image** | Added support for processing first detected face; could extend to multiple faces |
| **Varying lighting and orientations** | Enhanced preprocessing: resizing, normalization, optional CLAHE |
| **Unclear predictions** | Added HTML output and confidence threshold for "Unclear" cases |

## üéØ Future Work

- Real-time video/live stream detection  
- Integrate TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for faster inference  
- Enhance UI: Dark/Light mode toggle, zoom, tooltips  
- Add export options: CSV/images with results  
- Implement face alignment for tilted faces
